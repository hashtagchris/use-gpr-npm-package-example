# use-gpr-npm-package-example
A simple example of how to use a npm package in the GitHub Package Registry

Uses [@codertocat/hello-world-npm](https://github.com/Codertocat/hello-world-npm/packages/10696) to say hi. `.npmrc` has already been configured, so you just need to login to the GitHub Package Registry and install dependencies.

## Steps

1. [Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` and `read:packages` scopes.
2. Run `npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`, use the token created in step 1 as your password.
3. Run `npm install`. This downloads dependencies like [@codertocat/hello-world-npm](https://github.com/Codertocat/hello-world-npm/packages/10696) from https://npm.pkg.github.com to `node_modules`.
4. Optional: run `npm update @codertocat/hello-world-npm`
5. Run `node index.js`
6. Celebrate - you just made use of a GitHub Package Registry package! ðŸŽ‰
